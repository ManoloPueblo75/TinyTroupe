Welcome to the TinyTroupe wiki!

The TinyTroupe Python libraries leverages GPT-4 to simulate users under various conditions, with highly customizable personalities, thus allowing the automation many tasks that had to be done manually before - in software engineering, but also in product management and marketing, among other fields. This allow us to investigate a wide range of realistic interactions and consumer types. Here are some examples: 

  - TinyTroupe can evaluate Bing Ads offline with a simulated audience before spending money on them! 
  - TinyTroupe can provide test input to systems and then evaluate whether the outputs match the desired results. 
  - TinyTroupe can read project proposals and give feedback from the perspective of specific personas (e.g., physicians, lawyers, and knowledge workers in general). 
  - TinyTroupe can put in place of focus groups and deliver great product feedback at a fraction of the cost! 
  - TinyTroupe can chat with our chatbots/copilots and evaluate their quality too! 
  - TinyTroupe can generate realistic synthetic data that can be later used to train models or be subject to opportunity analyses.
