# Frequently Asked Questions

## Q: How does TinyTroupe differs from other LLM-based multiagent tools?

## Q: Can I directly use the simulation outputs for serious things?

**No!** This is a highly experimental project, and as such any of its outputs must be fully validated by a human before actually using them for anything.

## Q: So what's the point?

Simulations can be powerful **imagination enhancers** -- for instance, instead of imagining of a customer would do, using our limited brain power, we can delegate this to TinyTroupe, and cover much wider scenarios in a fraction of the time. Hence, one key application is the generation of insights, which can complement the human thought process.
