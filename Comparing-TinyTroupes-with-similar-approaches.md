LLM-based agents and multiagent systems are becoming popular ways of structuring applications. Understandably, current multiagent programming libraries and frameworks focus on problem-solving (e.g., programming) and assistive AI (e.g., chatbots or copilots). TinyTroupe, however, is a multiagent simulation library that focuses on simulation and experimentation, to support imagination enhancement and business insights. This brings unique benefits and requirements, which do not come naturally to existing problem-solving/assistive approaches. Below we compare (rather roughly) TinyTroupe with other LLM-based multiagent tools along some important dimensions:

As the field matures and the boundaries between simulation and problem-solving/assistive AI blur, it is possible -- maybe probable -- that these two overall stances will converge over time (e.g., via common higher-level abstractions). We hope to both learn from others and contribute original elements to this convergence.

***Note:** The above is a rough and incomplete comparison. It might also contain inacuracies due to both our own ignorance and the fast-paced evolution of the area. We'll update, complete and correct it if needed over time.*
